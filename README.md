#ParkFacilitiesTracking

Forked from https://github.com/digitalbrain79/darknet-nnpack/
Blog used to install NNPACK, OpenCV, and download Yolov3-tiny.cfg and Yolov3-tiny.weights is http://funofdiy.blogspot.com/2018/08/deep-learning-with-raspberry-pi-real.html

Using object detection with Yolo v3 Tiny, we hope to track usage of park facilities.
